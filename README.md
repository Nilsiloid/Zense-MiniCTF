# Zense-MiniCTF

I conducted a Mini CTF in my institute **IIIT-Bangalore** on the weekend of 12th-13th August, 2023 as a part of **Zense**, IIIT-B's software development club. This was a **basic CTF** with introductory challenges to encourange newcomers and beginners to attempt CTF challenges and competitions.
With the help of [**Icarus**](https://github.com/Icarus131) and [**Vijay**](https://github.com/vijay-jaisankar), I set challenges in the following categories:
- Cryptography
- Reverse Engineering
- OSINT
- Forensics
- Web Exploitation
- Miscellaneous

I learnt a lot while setting these challenges and had first-hand experience at organizing CTFs.

For each category, there is a separate folder containing each challenge(again as a folder).
For each challenge - there are 2 common files - chall.md and solve.md.

Refer to chall.md for the question provided to the CTF participants. Attempt the challenge and if you are stuck/have solved the chall, then move to solve.md to check your answer/see the solution.
If there are any attachments, they have been added in each challenges folder.
