# Solution

The challenge description provides a link to a github repository and mentions that the README.md file contains the key to success. Upon seeing the original page when visiting the link, it doesn't show anything other than the lyrics to "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley.

This is when we have to think about looking at the commit history of the README.md file. By searching through the commit history and the commits, you will come across [this_commit](https://github.com/vijay-jaisankar/readme-test/commit/3b8d886df421b4c4fdac2bd7adf7d0261ec147be). This clearly displays the addition of the flag to the README.md file.

The flag is:
