# Solution

The challenge description mentions a gold css badge. Upon googling, the top 2 links are credly and stack overflow. The challenge name is a link to stack overflow. Upon finding people who received the gold css badge in May, 2014, there’s quite a few there. Again we go back to the challenge description and notice the W is capitalized. This points to Rob Wu and SW4. Here, it’s a bit based on luck but it’s Rob Wu who is our “guy”. Upon seeing his profile, we find his website link and that leads to his Github. Now, scroll down to find his contributions in all the years. For the first repository, we will go to the year 2012 and find the earliest possible activity there. Upon searching, you will find 9th June as the day he created his first repository. That solves the first part.
<br />

Now, we can also find the link to his LinkedIn on the website. Since his college is mentioned in the description, we will look at his education and the first part’s description mentions the collaboration. Thus we have solved the second part as well.
